# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? A system that allows multiple users to edit information and control the outcome through a master file. Why is it useful? Multiple users can work on different parts of the version and upload the information to the master file without conflicting with other programmers code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one? Branch allows you to work on a different part of the whole code. This allows multiple programmers to work on a single code but different aspects of the code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? Commit is the message that you display to any changes that you have made. Very useful to inform other programmers of the changes that you have made.

* What is a merge conflict? Merge conflict is when one or more code is overlapping and conflicting with each other.
