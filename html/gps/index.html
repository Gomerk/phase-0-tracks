    What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

    Using HTMl5 semantic tags is useful because it improves the automated processing of documents which websites use to help rank them.  Most tags are useful they all play a part of what you see on the website. However i'd say header seems to play a giant role due to it being the main starter of the page.

    What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
    read top to bottom so all elements written top to bottom within the body would proceed as that


    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

    Learned that snippet is pretty awesome! And yes I believe I will be creating some of my own!


    What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

    Most the concepts were pretty straight forward but I know that I can improve further on the HTML language since there is so much more that you can do with the language.
